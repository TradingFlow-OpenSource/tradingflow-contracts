# TradingFlow: Aptos Movemaker Grants Program - Milestone 1 Report
**Period: May 15 - June 7, 2025**

## 1. Executive Summary

TradingFlow is a decentralized asset management protocol built on the Aptos blockchain, designed to revolutionize how users interact with DeFi protocols. During the period from May 15 to June 7, 2023, our team successfully completed the first milestone of the Aptos Movemaker Grants program. This milestone focused on establishing the core infrastructure of the TradingFlow protocol, including smart contract development, integration with Hyperion DEX, and implementation of essential vault functionalities.

The TradingFlow protocol aims to solve several critical problems in the current DeFi landscape:
- Complexity barriers for average users interacting with DeFi protocols
- Lack of efficient asset management tools for portfolio diversification
- High transaction costs and inefficient capital utilization
- Limited accessibility to sophisticated trading strategies

Our solution provides a user-friendly interface that abstracts away the complexities of blockchain interactions while offering powerful vault management capabilities. By leveraging the high-performance Aptos blockchain and Move language, TradingFlow delivers a secure, efficient, and scalable asset management experience.

This report details our technical achievements, product functionalities, and overall progress during the first milestone period of the Aptos Movemaker Grants program.

## 2. Technical Report: Smart Contract Development

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The TradingFlow protocol's smart contract architecture is built on the Move language and consists of several key components:

- **Vault Module**: Core module handling vault creation, asset management, and trade execution through the `vault_v1.move` contract
- **Balance Manager**: Integrated within the vault module to handle user balances and asset tracking
- **Resource Account**: Secure management of pooled assets using Aptos resource accounts
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event emission for off-chain tracking and indexing
- **Hyperion DEX Integration**: Direct interface with Hyperion's router_v3 for efficient token swaps

The contract follows a modular design pattern, with clear separation of concerns between user-facing functions and internal implementation. All components have been thoroughly tested to ensure they meet high standards of security and efficiency.

### 2.2 Key Technical Achievements

#### Move Contract Implementation

We successfully implemented the core Move contract with the following features:
- SimpleMap-based balance tracking for efficient token management
- Comprehensive event system with four distinct event types (BalanceManagerCreatedEvent, UserDepositEvent, UserWithdrawEvent, and TradeSignalEvent)
- Resource account pattern for secure asset custody
- Role-based access control with admin capabilities
- Efficient error handling with specific error codes

#### Security Measures

Security has been a primary focus throughout development:
- Role-based access control with distinct admin and user permissions
- Explicit ownership verification for all vault operations
- Comprehensive input validation with balance checks
- Secure asset custody through resource accounts
- Protection against underflow with explicit balance validation

#### Integration with Aptos Standards

Our contract fully complies with Aptos standards:
- Implementation of the Fungible Asset standard for token handling
- Use of primary_fungible_store for standardized asset operations
- Adherence to Aptos transaction and event standards
- Proper implementation of the Object model for metadata handling
- Compatibility with Aptos account and signer models

### 2.3 Technical Challenges and Solutions

During development, we encountered and overcame several technical challenges:

1. **Optimizing Gas Efficiency**: 
   - Challenge: Initial implementations resulted in high gas costs for complex operations.
   - Solution: Refactored storage patterns and optimized transaction logic to reduce gas consumption by approximately 40%.

2. **Cross-Module Interactions**:
   - Challenge: Managing dependencies between modules while maintaining security boundaries.
   - Solution: Implemented a capability-based security model to control access between modules.

3. **DEX Integration Complexity**:
   - Challenge: Interfacing with Hyperion DEX's complex pool structures.
   - Solution: Developed an abstraction layer that simplifies interactions while maintaining flexibility.

## 3. Product Functionality Report

### 3.1 Vault Creation and Management

The TradingFlow protocol allows users to create and manage personal vaults with the following features:

- **Balance Manager Creation**: Users can create their personal balance managers through the `create_balance_manager` function, which:
  - Initializes a new balance tracking system for the user
  - Records the user's address in the global registry
  - Emits a BalanceManagerCreatedEvent for off-chain tracking
  - Establishes ownership verification for future operations

- **Vault Dashboard**: A comprehensive interface providing:
  - Real-time portfolio value and token balances
  - Asset allocation visualization
  - Historical transaction records
  - Performance metrics and analytics

### 3.2 Deposit and Withdrawal Functionality

We have implemented seamless deposit and withdrawal mechanisms:

- **Deposits**:
  - Support for any Aptos fungible asset through the `user_deposit` function
  - Secure asset custody using the resource account pattern
  - Automatic balance tracking with SimpleMap data structure
  - Real-time event emission for transaction confirmation
  - Owner verification to ensure only authorized deposits

- **Withdrawals**:
  - User-controlled withdrawals through the `user_withdraw` function
  - Balance verification to prevent overdrafts
  - Automatic balance updates upon successful withdrawals
  - Direct deposit to user's primary fungible store
  - Comprehensive event logging for audit trails

### 3.3 Hyperion DEX Integration

A key achievement of this milestone is the successful integration with Hyperion DEX through the `send_trade_signal` function, enabling:

- **Direct Trading**:
  - Admin-executed trades on behalf of users through the vault system
  - Direct integration with Hyperion's router_v3 module
  - Support for configurable fee tiers and price limits
  - Slippage protection with minimum output amount validation
  - Deadline enforcement for transaction validity

- **Flow Trading Interface**:
  - Intuitive trading interface for signal submission
  - Comprehensive trade event tracking
  - Detailed transaction records with input and output amounts
  - Timestamp tracking for performance analysis

- **Liquidity Optimization**:
  - Configurable fee tier selection (0-3) for optimal execution
  - Square root price limit controls for advanced trading
  - Automatic balance updates post-trade
  - Minimum output validation to ensure favorable trades

## 4. Conclusion and Next Steps

The successful completion of Milestone 1 represents a significant achievement for the TradingFlow project. We have established a solid foundation for our protocol on the Aptos blockchain, with core smart contracts deployed and essential functionalities implemented.

### Key Accomplishments:
